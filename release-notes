# Release v0.2.2 (29th May 2021)

New release, thanks to contributions by Liongrass, Talkless and parazyd
And thanks to everyone else who contributed via discussion and donations

* Rewrite mempool handling to always be responsive. Previously the server
  would massively lag if the mempool was large, so most users just disabled
  the mempool histogram. With this update that is no longer an issue.
* If Electrum Personal Server fails at startup it will now return a non-zero
  error code, making it more usable with automated scripts like systemd.
* Client will now warn user if tor broadcasting fails because tor is not
  accessible.
* Various optimizations and bug fixes.

# Release v0.2.1.1 (9th June 2020)

Bugfix release. Thanks to everyone who reported the bug and jmacxx who wrote
the pull request to fix it. And thanks to everyone who contributed in general
to electrum personal server.

* Fixed bug where the server would crash in certain conditions. Instead the
  server should have caught the error and continued.

# Release v0.2.1 (4th June 2020)

New release, thanks to contributions by DriftwoodPalace, m-schmoock and wiredcheetah
And thanks to everyone else who contributed via discussion and donations

* Massive speedup to startup time and initial import of addresses. This is done
  using the descriptor wallets feature of Bitcoin Core 0.20. The speedup is
  very helpful when running Electrum Personal Server on low powered devices
  such as the raspberry pi
* Close the connection to client if it requests an unknown address or if the
  connection to the Bitcoin node is lost. The user will see a red dot in
  Electrum indicating that something is wrong which should prompt them to fix.
* Increase default polling interval to make the server more responsive to new
  transactions and confirmations
* Reduce spam in the debug log and info log
* Various other tweaks and bug fixes

# Release v0.2.0 (5th December 2019)

New release, thanks to code contributions by suvayu, andrewtoth and Sosthene00
And thanks to everyone else who contributed via discussion and donations

* Implemented tor broadcasting of transactions, which happens by default if tor
  is running on the same machine.
* Also check that the last address of each master public key has been imported,
  along with the first three.
* Add bandwidth usage per day and blockchain size to the server banner
* Support using `vsize` instead of `size` for the mempool calculation, which is
  the correct behaviour for Bitcoin Core 0.19
* Allow rescan date to also be passed via CLI args. Wait for any rescanning to
  finish on startup. This allows Electrum Personal Server to be more easily
  used with scripting.
* Various other bugfixes

# Release v0.1.7 (26th April 2019)

New release, thanks to code contributions by suvayu and andrewtoth
And thanks to everyone else who contributed via discussion and donations

* If pruning is enabled and block is not available then send dummy merkle
  proof, which Electrum will accept if run with the command line
  flag --skipmerklecheck
* Added option to allow broadcasting unconfirmed transactions via any
  system call, for example it could be a shell script which broadcasts
  via SMS or radio.
* Added option which allows disabling the mempool histogram feature
  which is useful on low-powered devices when the mempool is large.
* Deprecated electrum-personal-server-rescan script in favour of
  electrum-personal-server --rescan
* Releases will now also be packaged as windows binaries using pyinstaller.
* No longer adds orphaned coinbase txes as unconfirmed.
* Fix bug involving transactions with unconfirmed inputs.
* Various other bugfixes

* Deterministic wallets implemented which support all Electrum master public
  key formats.
* Created rescan script which allows rescanning from a given block height
  instead of scanning the entire blockchain. Also allows the user to input a
  dd/mm/yyyy timestamp, which is converted to a block height (with 2 weeks
  safety) to rescan from there.
* Automated tests created for merkle proofs, deterministic wallets and
  monitoring of transactions.
* SSL server socket is used and a default SSL certificate is included in the
  repository, which users can replace with their own.
* No longer depends on pybitcointools' transaction code. That package is only
  used for bip32 support for deterministic wallets. Bech32 addresses now
  supported.
* RPC auth details can be obtained from the .cookie file.
* Bitcoin Core's multi-wallet feature supported.


# Alpha release - (8th Feb 2018)
